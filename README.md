# AI-Generated Image Detection with VGG19

This project focuses on detecting AI-generated images using a pre-trained VGG19 model and generating explanations for the classification decisions. The approach leverages deep learning techniques to identify artifacts in images that may indicate synthetic content.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. **Identify AI-generated images**: Using a convolutional neural network (VGG19) to classify images as real or AI-generated.
2. **Generate Explanations**: Provide visual and textual explanations for the classification, highlighting the features that contributed to the model’s decision.

## Features

- **VGG19 Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained VGG19 model for feature extraction and classification.
- **Artifact Detection**: Identifies subtle artifacts in images that may suggest they were AI-generated.
- **Explainability**: Offers interpretability for model decisions using techniques like Grad-CAM or similar methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `tensorflow`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `opencv-python`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-image-detection-vgg19.git
   cd ai-image-detection-vgg19
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook vision_artifact_analysis-VGG19.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the cells in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess images.
   - Use the VGG19 model for image classification.
   - Visualize the artifacts and explanations for the model’s decisions.

## Project Structure

- **vision_artifact_analysis-VGG19.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations.
- **images/**: Directory to store test images (add your images here for analysis).
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies.

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized for input into the VGG19 model.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The VGG19 model extracts features from images, which are then analyzed for artifact detection.
3. **Classification and Explanation**:
   - Classify images as real or AI-generated.
   - Use techniques like Grad-CAM to generate heatmaps that visualize regions influencing the model's decision.

## Results

- Explanation of the model’s performance on sample datasets.
- Visual examples of real and AI-generated images with highlighted artifacts.

## Future Work

- Improving the explainability techniques.
- Extending the model to detect artifacts from different types of generative models.
- Fine-tuning the VGG19 model for better accuracy on specific datasets.
